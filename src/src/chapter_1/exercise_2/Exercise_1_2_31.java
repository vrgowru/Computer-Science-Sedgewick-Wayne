 * @param - input λ0, lat and long
 *
 * @implSpec - “Mercator projection. The Mercator projection is a conformal
 * (angle-preserving) projection that maps latitude φ and longitude λ to rectangular
 * coordinates (x, y). It is widely used—for example, in nautical charts and in the
 * maps that you print from the web. The projection is defined by the equations
 * x = λ – λ0 and y = 1/2 ln ((1 + sin φ) / (1 – sin φ)), where λ0 is the longitude
 * of the point in the center of the map. Write a program that takes λ0 and the
 * latitude and longitude of a point from the command line and prints its projection.”
