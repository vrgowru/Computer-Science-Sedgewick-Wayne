 * @implSpec - “Dragon curves. Write a program to print the instructions
 * for drawing the dragon curves of order 0 through 5. The instructions are
 * strings of F, L, and R characters, where F means
 * “draw line while moving 1 unit forward,” L means “turn left,”
 * and R means “turn right.” A dragon curve of order n is formed
 * when you fold a strip of paper in half n times, then unfold to right angles.
 * The key to solving this problem is to note that a curve of order n is a curve
 * of order n–1 followed by an L followed by a curve of order n–1 traversed
 * in reverse order, and then to figure out a similar description for the reverse curve.”
