 * @implSpec - Write a program Kary that takes two integer command line arguments
 * i and k and converts i to base k. Assume that i is an integer in Javaâ€™s long
 * data type and that k is an integer between 2 and 16. For bases greater than 10,
 * use the letters A through F to represent the 11th through 16th digits, respectively.
